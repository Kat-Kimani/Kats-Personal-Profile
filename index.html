    <h2>Who is Kat Kimani:</h2>
    <p>I am a career changer; with a back ground in accounting and finance and vast experience in administration and
        operations, I find myself drawn to tech over the last couple of years.
        A recent graduate from Strathmore University with a diploma in Business IT and current student at Moringa
        School coding camp</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p> I have been developing my technology skills., So I dropped my 8-5pm job and decided to delve into tech.
        I am passionate about technology & web development and I love digging in to learn new tech skills, and at the rate thing
        are changing, there will always be new things to learn!</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I am an accumulator of hobbies. This means I'm constantly trying new creative things! Sometimes
        that looks like building a new website (like this one!) over the course of a weekend. And other times it means
        finding an online class on how to bake and grill. Im a foodie, so my
        favourite hobby is cooking good food. I also make art from old slippers. You'll see some of those things showcased in my portfolio because they are
        a part of me.</p>
